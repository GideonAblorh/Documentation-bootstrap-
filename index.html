                    Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end
                    web development. It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography,
                    forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.
                    Bootstrap is the seventh-most-starred project on GitHub, with more than 142,000 stars,
                    behind freeCodeCamp (almost 312,000 stars) and marginally behind Vue.js framework.
                    According to Alexa Rank, Bootstrap is in the top-2000 in the USA while vuejs.org is in the top-7000
                    in the USA.

            <h3>Early beginnings</h3>
            <article>
                <p>Bootstrap, originally named Twitter Blueprint, was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at
                    Twitter as a framework to encourage consistency across internal tools. Before Bootstrap, various
                    libraries were used for interface development, which led to inconsistencies and a high maintenance
                    burden. According to Twitter developer Mark Otto:

                    A super small group of developers and I got together to design and build a new internal tool and saw
                    an opportunity to do something more. Through that process, we saw ourselves build something much
                    more substantial than another internal tool. Months later, we ended up with an early version of
                    Bootstrap as a way to document and share common design patterns and assets within the company.[4]

                    After a few months of development by a small group, many developers at Twitter began to contribute
                    to the project as a part of Hack Week, a hackathon-style week for the Twitter development team. It
                    was renamed from Twitter Blueprint to Bootstrap, and released as an open source project on August
                    19, 2011.[5] It has continued to be maintained by Mark Otto, Jacob Thornton, and a small group of
                    core developers, as well as a large community of contributors.</p>

            <article>
                <p>
                    On January 31, 2012, Bootstrap 2 was released, which added built-in support for Glyphicons, several
                    new components, as well as changes to many of the existing components. This version supports
                    responsive web design, meaning the layout of web pages adjusts dynamically, taking into account the
                    characteristics of the device used (whether desktop, tablet, or mobile phone).[7]

                    The next major version, Bootstrap 3, was released on August 19, 2013. It redesigned components to
                    use flat design and a mobile first approach.[

                    Mark Otto announced Bootstrap 4 on October 29, 2014.[9] The first alpha version of Bootstrap 4 was
                    released on August 19, 2015.[10] The first beta version was released on 10 August 2017.[11] Mark
                    suspended work on Bootstrap 3 on September 6, 2016, to free up time to work on Bootstrap 4.
                    Bootstrap 4 was finalized on January 18, 2018.
                    Significant changes include:

                <p>
                    Bootstrap is a web framework that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web pages
                    (as opposed to web apps). The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's
                    choices of color, size, font and layout to that project. As such, the primary factor is whether the
                    developers in charge find those choices to their liking. Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides
                    basic style definitions for all HTML elements. The result is a uniform appearance for prose, tables
                    and form elements across web browsers. In addition, developers can take advantage of CSS classes
                    defined in Bootstrap to further customize the appearance of their contents. For example, Bootstrap
                    has provisioned for light- and dark-colored tables, page headings, more prominent pull quotes, and
                    text with a highlight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bootstrap also comes with several JavaScript components in the form of jQuery plugins. They provide
                    additional user interface elements such as dialog boxes, tooltips, and carousels. Each Bootstrap
                    component consists of an HTML structure, CSS declarations, and in some cases accompanying JavaScript
                    code. They also extend the functionality of some existing interface elements, including for example
                    an auto-complete function for input fields.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most prominent components of Bootstrap are its layout components, as they affect an entire web
                    page. The basic layout component is called "Container", as every other element in the page is placed
                    in it. Developers can choose between a fixed-width container and a fluid-width container. While the
                    latter always fills the width of the web page, the former uses one of the four predefined fixed
                    widths, depending on the size of the screen showing the page:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Smaller than 576 pixels</li>
                    <li>576–768 pixels</li>
                    <li>768–992 pixels</li>
                    <li>992–1200 pixels</li>
                    <li>Larger than 1200 pixels</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Once a container is in place, other Bootstrap layout components implement a CSS Flexbox layout
                    through defining rows and columns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A precompiled version of Bootstrap is available in the form of one CSS file and three JavaScript
                    files that can be readily added to any project. The raw form of Bootstrap, however, enables
                    developers to implement further customization and size optimizations. This raw form is modular,
                    meaning that the developer can remove unneeded components, apply a theme and modify the uncompiled
                    Sass files.
